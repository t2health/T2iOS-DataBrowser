/**
 * @brief A JRProfile object
 **/
@interface JRProfile : JRCaptureObject
/**
 * \c YES if this object can be updated on Capture with the method JRProfile#updateOnCaptureForDelegate:context:().
 * \c NO if it can't.
 *
 * Use this property to determine if the object or element can be updated on Capture or if this object's parent array
 * needs to be replaced first. As this object, or one of its ancestors, is an element of a plural, this object may or
 * may not be updated on Capture. If an element of a plural was added locally (newly allocated on the client), then the
 * array must be replaced before the element can use the method JRProfile#updateOnCaptureForDelegate:context:().
 * Even if JRProfile#needsUpdate returns \c YES, this object cannot be updated on Capture unless
 * JRProfile#canBeUpdatedOnCapture also returns \c YES.
 *
 * That is, if any elements of a plural have changed, (added, removed, or reordered) the array
 * must be replaced on Capture with the appropriate <code>replace&lt;<em>ArrayName</em>&gt;ArrayOnCaptureForDelegate:context:</code>
 * method, before updating the elements. As such, this should be done immediately.
 *
 * @note
 * Replacing the array will also update any local changes to the properties of a JRProfile, including
 * sub-arrays and sub-objects.
